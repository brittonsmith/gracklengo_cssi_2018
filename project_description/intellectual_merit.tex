\section{Intellectual Merit}

\grackle{} is a vital scientific software element to the astrophysical
community with demonstrated use in many different simulation codes and
semi-analytic modeling.  The library exposes functionality equally to
simulation codes written in C, C++, Fortran, and Python with an API
that has been designed with careful consideration for maintaining
backward compatibility.  The \texttt{pygrackle} Python interface links
\grackle{} to other cross-platform astrophysical tools like \yt{},
making it a complement to the ecosystem of scientific software.
The \grackle{} project is developed using
best practices and follows an established model for community
development and code releases.  This model includes external review of
source code changes through Pull Requests, automated testing, and
extensive user and developer documentation.

This SSE will enable significant improvements to be made to the
\grackle{} library that will ensure it continues to be a crucial
component of astrophysical research.  The code will be more flexible
and developer-friendly, and will have key features added that will
expand the user base.  The upgraded parallelism will enable
effective utilization of next-generation computing facilities and will
provide a model for developers as they add new features to the code.
