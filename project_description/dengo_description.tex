\section{\dengo{}: Solver Generation and Network Visualization}

\mjt{Desrcibe Dengo here.}

The rate transformation of one species to another due to two-body chemical kinetic
reactions can be written down in this form:

$$
\frac{\partial n_i }{\partial t} = \sum_{j}\sum_{l} k_{jl}n_{j}n_{l} + \sum_{j}I_{j}n_{j}
$$

Here, we use $n_{i}$ to denote species $i$, ${k_jl}$ to denote the kinetic rate
coefficient for the reaction between species $j$ and $l$ that produces species
$i$, and $I_{j}$ is the radiative process rate from $j$ to $i$.  Primordial
chemistry also often includes three-body reactions, such as those that
form molecular hydrogen while utilizing a third body as a catalyst.  It is
notable that this defines the \textit{entire} system of two-body reactions;
where we see reductions in species, the reaction rate is negative and includes
species ${i}$.

\mjt{Gotta think about perceived weaknesses}

Generating a reaction network from this involves constructing a change vector,
$\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial t}$ for all pairwise combinations and sets of
reactions.  From the perspective of implementation, this requires considerable
bookkeeping for each additional species and each additional reaction.  For
example, adding a single reaction rate that operates on two species requires
updating the species change vectors for each of those two species; when
optimizing for computational architectures -- such as SIMD instructions, memory
management for interpolation tables, and reducing cache misses -- this adds
not-inconsiderable overhead for the developer.  Furthermore, operations that
change the mechanism by which the solver operates, such as changing from
semi-implicit updates to a fully-implicit scheme, require full reorganization
of the solver code.

Dengo is a platform for generating chemical kinetic rate equation solvers that
remain independent of the mechanism for executing that solution.

\mjt{Add diagram of how Dengo works -- maybe some boxes}

Dengo includes full reaction networks for primordial gas, ionization of
interstellar, and formation of molecules using \mjt{UMIST}.  Constructing a
solver using Dengo is done by choosing a collection of species to evolve,
choosing the relevant chemical kinetic and radiative cooling equations that
interlink them, and then identifying the solver that will update the coupled
differential equations at each timestep.
