\section{Science Enabled}

\bds{Talk about all the fun science everyone could do!}

Local star formation (need to discuss why complex networks are
essential for this, linking to observations or star forming regions,
etc.)

Tracking individual abundances in galaxy formation simulations to
connect with Milky Way/Local Group stellar abundances/stellar archaeology.

Non-equilibrium ionization in IGM/CGM. Point to the few existing
papers and how they are very obviously limited by how expensive this
is.

Primordial stars too duh

Planets and ices and stuff

Dust evolution in supernova remnants
